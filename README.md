# Plexil Documentation Draft
This temporary repository serves to present the Plexil documentation built with Sphinx.
After installing Sphinx you can use `make html` to invoke the Makefile in the current directory and see the results in `_build/html`.
There currently exists a built version in `_build/html`. Open `main.html` with your favorite browser and check the current compiled version.

`conf.py` contains all the configurations (theme, footer, ...).
Images are located in `_static/images`.
