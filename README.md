# Plexil Documentation Source
This repository serves to present the Plexil documentation built with Sphinx.
After installing Sphinx you can use `make html` to invoke the Makefile in the current directory and see the results in `_build/html`.

There currently exists a built version in `docs` folder. Open `index.html` with your favorite browser and check the current compiled version. The generated documentation also can be found at: https://plexil-group.github.io/plexil_docs/
To find the source code please go to the main *PLEXIL* project page at: https://github.com/plexil-group/plexil
