Introduction
=============

Welcome to |PLEXIL|!

This is the reference manual for the |PLEXIL| language and related tools
included in the software distribution. The latest version of this manual
is always found online at
`plexil.sourceforge.net <http://plexil.sourceforge.net>`_.

We are striving to make the language and system increasingly usable and
better documented, so any feedback you have is greatly appreciated.
Comments and questions are welcome. If you encounter any material you
find confusing, or is inadequate for your needs, please contact
plexil-support@sourceforge.net and we'll do our best to help you and to
improve the manual.

We hope you enjoy using |PLEXIL| and find it well-suited to your needs.
