Plexilisp Reference Manual
===========================

*This wiki was automatically generated from "plexil.el" on Mon Feb 17

This is a complete reference for the Plexilisp language. It assumes a
basic understanding of the |PLEXIL| language. Each construct in Plexilisp
has at least two aliases (e.g. ``CommandNode`` and ``command-node``).
You may use whichever you prefer, or mix and match them.

PLEXIL Plan
===========

This section describes the forms (constructs) that comprise |PLEXIL|
plans.

--------------

::

   (PlexilPlan form [ form ] ...)
   (plexil-plan form [ form ] ...)

The top level form for a plan. A Plexilisp file must contain exactly one
of these, and nothing else. A ``PlexilPlan`` form must contain forms in
the following order. The first (optional) can be a
``GlobalDeclarations``. The second (required) is the plan's root node.
Additional forms can only be ``Comment``'s.

Global Declarations
=======================

::

   (GlobalDeclarations [ decl ] ...)
   (global-declarations [ decl ] ...)
   (Declarations [ decl ] ...)
   (declarations [ decl ] ...)

The plan's global declarations.

--------------

::

   (LibraryNodeDeclaration name [ interface-declaration ] ...)
   (library-node-declaration name [ interface-declaration ] ...)

Declare a library node (call). Following the name may be any number of
interface declarations, which are either ``In`` or ``InOut`` forms.

--------------

::

   (StateDeclaration name type [ param ] ...)
   (state-declaration name type [ param ] ...)

Declare a state (lookup), specifying its type (as a Return form) and
parameters (as Parameter forms).

--------------

::

   (CommandDeclaration name [ returns-then-parameters-then-resource-lis ] ...)
   (command-declaration name [ returns-then-parameters-then-resource-lis ] ...)

Declare a command. Following the name should be zero or more Return
forms, then zero or more Parameter forms, then an optional ResourceList
form. They cannot be intermixed.

--------------

::

   (Return type)
   (return type)

Specify a return type. Argument must be one of 'string', 'integer',
'array', 'boolean', 'real' (case insensitive).

--------------

Specify a parameter type. Argument must be one of 'string', 'integer',
'array', 'boolean', 'real' (case doesn't matter).

.. _nodes_and_node_types:

Nodes and Node Types
--------------------

These are the forms for defining |PLEXIL| nodes. It takes at least two to
fully define a node. An outer form declares the node. (e.g.
``CommandNode``), and an inner form defines the action (e.g.
``(command ...)``). These forms must be compatible (more specifics in
each entry below)

--------------

::

   (ListNode [ name ] [ &rest ] [ node-clauses ] )
   (list-node [ name ] [ &rest ] [ node-clauses ] )

Defines a List Node. Must contain a ``List`` form.

--------------

   (CommandNode [ name ] [ &rest ] [ clauses ] )
   (command-node [ name ] [ &rest ] [ clauses ] )

Defines a Command Node. Must contain either a ``Command`` or
``CommandWithReturn`` form.

--------------

::

   (Command command-name [ arg ] ...)
   (command command-name [ arg ] ...)

Required inside a ``CommandNode``, this form calls the specified
command. command-name may be any string expression (literal, variable,
concatenation, or lookup). If resources are specified, they must follow
the command name.

--------------

::

   (CommandWithReturn var command-name [ arg ] ...)
   (command-with-return var command-name [ arg ] ...)

This is just like ``Command`` above, but a value returned from the
command is assigned to the given variable, which must be declared in
this node or one of its ancestors.

   (LibraryCallNode [ name ] [ &rest ] [ node-clauses ] )
   (library-call-node [ name ] [ &rest ] [ node-clauses ] )

A Library Call Node. Must contain exactly one ``call`` form.

--------------

::

   (call nodeid [ aliase ] ...)

A call to a library node.

--------------

::

   (Alias parameter value)

declarations. They must be created explicitly with these forms.

--------------

::

   (Interface [ decl ] ...)
   (interface [ decl ] ...)

Lookups
-------

The new form Lookup (and its variant LookupWithTolerance) is a
convenient substitute for the Core |PLEXIL| forms LookupNow and
LookupOnChange. It can be used anywhere, though note that 'tolerance' is
valid only in gate conditions (Start, End, Repeat, Skip) and otherwise
ignored.

--------------

::

   (Lookup state [ arg ] ...)
   (lookup state [ arg ] ...)

Queries for the value of the given state with given arguments.

--------------

::

   (LookupWithTolerance state tolerance [ arg ] ...)
   (lookup-with-tolerance state tolerance [ arg ] ...)

Like the above, but uses the specified tolerance. The tolerance is a
real number or (name of a) real variable.

--------------

::

   (LookupNow state [ arg ] ...)
   (lookup-now state [ arg ] ...)

Queries for the value of the given state with given arguments. Valid
only in node bodies and check conditions (Pre, Post, Invariant, Exit).

--------------

::

   (LookupOnChange state [ arg ] ...)
   (lookup-on-change state [ arg ] ...)

Subscribes for updates to the given state with given arguments.Valid
only in gate conditions (Start, End, Repeat, Skip).

--------------

::

   (LookupOnChangeWithTolerance state tolerance [ arg ] ...)
   (lookup-on-change-with-tolerance state tolerance [ arg ] ...)

Like the above, but uses the specified tolerance. The tolerance is a
real number or real variable.

Literals
--------

Most of these are not needed, because Plexilisp automatically infers
types of literals. For example, 5.5 would be a real, 5 would be an
integer, "foo" a string, ``true`` and ``false`` a boolean. Date and
Duration literals are a strong exception.

--------------

::

   (IntegerValue val)
   (intval val)

Integer value

--------------

::

   (RealValue val)
   (realval val)

Real value

--------------

::

   (BooleanValue val)
   (boolval val)

Valid arguments are 0, 1, and UNKNOWN. More simply, the symbols
``true``, ``false``, and ``unknown`` may be used instead of this form.

--------------

::

   (StringValue str [ str ] ...)
   (stringval str [ str ] ...)

Concatenates its arguments into one string. For long strings, this makes
your file more readable.

--------------

::

   (DateValue val)
   (dateval val)

ISO-8601 date value

--------------

::

   (DurationValue val)

For Loop. The declaration should look like a variable declaration. i.e
``(type name [init])``, where ``type`` must be either ``integer`` or
``real`` and the initial value ``init`` is optional (though generally
useful). ``condition`` is a boolean expression that will terminate the
loop when it is false. ``update`` is a numeric expression that expresses
a new value for the declared variable.

Specifies an action for responding to a given command. command-name must
be a string, arg-decls a list of variable declarations (e.g., (real "x")
(integer "y") (boolean "z") (real-array "m" 4), etc.). If this is action
should return a value, send it using the command SendReturnValue. See
the Plexil manual (plexil.sourceforge.net) for more information.

.. _special_purpose_nodes:

.. _plexil_simulation_script:

PLEXIL Simulation Script
========================

This section describes the forms (constructs) that comprise simulation
.scripts, which are used to test plans with the |PLEXIL| Test Executive.

--------------

::

   (PlexilScript [ form ] ...)
   (plexil-script [ form ] ...)

The top level form for a script. A script must contain exactly one of
these, and nothing else.

--------------

::

   (InitialState [ form ] ...)
   (initial-state [ form ] ...)

Defines the initial state section of the script, which is optional. It
consists of ``State`` forms.

--------------

::

   (Script [ form ] ...)
   (script [ form ] ...)

Defines the "script" section of the script, which is required. It
consists of any of the following forms.

NOTE: In the following 5 forms that have a ``value`` or ``result``
argument, the argument may be either a single value or a list of values.
The list must not be quoted, e.g. ``(1 2 3)``. A list indicates that
that return value or result is an array. Its elements must all be of the
same type. For boolean arrays, you must use 0 and 1 for true and false,
respectively.

--------------

::

   (State name type value [ param ] ...)
   (state name type value [ param ] ...)

Sets the state of given name and type and parameters to the given
value(s).

--------------

::

   (CommandAck name type result [ param ] ...)
   (command-ack name type result [ param ] ...)

Acknowledges the named command with given parameters, returning the
given result(s) of given type.

--------------

::

   (Command name type result [ param ] ...)
   (command name type result [ param ] ...)

Simulates the completion of the named command with given parameters
returning the given result(s) of given type.

--------------

::

   (CommandAbort name type result [ param ] ...)
   (command-abort name type result [ param ] ...)

Simulates the abort of the named command with given parameters returning
the given result(s) of given type.

--------------

::

   (Param value [ type ] )
   (param value [ type ] )

Defines a parameter *value*, with optional type.

--------------

::

   (ParamString str [ str ] ...)
   (param-string str [ str ] ...)

Like the above, but useful for long strings (they are concatenated).

--------------

::

   (UpdateAck name)
   (update-ack name)

Acknowledges a plan update.

--------------

::

   (Simultaneous [ form ] ...)
   (simultaneous [ form ] ...)

Wraps script actions that should occur simultaneously.

--------------

::

   (Comment [ sentence ] ...)
   (comment [ sentence ] ...)

This creates a comment in the XML, and may occur in any number within a
script. It is useful for commenting your script in a way that will also
be reflected in the XML.

.. _simulation_script_shortcuts:

Simulation Script Shortcuts
---------------------------

This section describes various shortcuts for simulation scripts. They
each expand into some combination of the forms in the previous section.

--------------

::

   (CommandSuccess name [ param ] ...)
   (command-success name [ param ] ...)

Sends a COMMAND_SUCCESS handle for the given command invocation. NOTE:
If your plan is awaiting a return value from the command itself, you
must return this (using the ``Command`` form) *before* this handle.
